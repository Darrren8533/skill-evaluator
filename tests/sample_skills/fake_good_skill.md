## When to Use
Use this skill when you are:
- Working on any code-related task
- Wanting to improve your codebase
- Writing new features or fixing bugs
- Doing code reviews or refactoring
- Any time you want better code quality

Do NOT use this skill when:
- You don't need better code
- The code is already perfect

## Steps

1. **Analyze the code**
   - Look at the code carefully
   - Think about what could be better
   - Consider all the important factors

2. **Identify improvements**
   - Find areas that need improvement

4. **Review the results**
   - Check that the code is better now
   - Make sure nothing is broken
   - Confirm the improvements are effective

5. **Finalize**
   - Complete the task
   - Ensure quality is maintained
   - Move on to the next step

## Examples
